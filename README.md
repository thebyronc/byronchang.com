# Byron Chang Portfolio (byronchang.com)

## Quick Start

1. **Install Gatsby cli**

    `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

1. **Clone this repository with**

    `git clone`

1. **Chang directory into the cloned repository with**
    
    `cd bcsite`

1. **Install required dependencies** 
    
    `npm install`

1. **To run a development server use** 

    `gatsby develop`

1. **Local site should be accessable via** 

    `http://localhost:8000`
    

## Coding Practices and Style Guide

- Use .jsx extension for React component files

- Always use eslint and prettier (.eslintrc is included in the repo and prettier is set up to run through eslint, go [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) for help setting it up)

- This site uses Styled Components. Install `https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components` for VS Code for styled components highlighting. If you're not using VS Code, look for a similar plugin for your code editor.

- Use PascalCase for React components names - file names, `class` and `const` names.

**ONE EXCEPTION**. `pages` file names names MUST BE LOWER CASE. Gatsby routing will not work otherwise.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
